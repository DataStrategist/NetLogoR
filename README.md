# NetLogoR
NetLogoR is an R package which aims to easily help translate models built in NetLogo ([Wilensky, 1999](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)) into R.

NetLogoR provides functions to build a world with agents similarly as in NetLogo, as well as the [NetLogo's primitives](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html).
A programming guide derived from the [NetLogoâ€™s Programming Guide](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html) is available. 

Translating NetLogo models into R can help increase simulation speed for certain models and allow multi-models interaction. 
Models built with NetLogoR could then be used with a discrete event simulator, such as SpaDES.

This package is under construction and therefore function errors and mismatchs with the programming guide may occur.
