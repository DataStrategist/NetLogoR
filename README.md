`NetLogoR` is an R package which aims to help translating agent-based models built in NetLogo ([Wilensky, 1999](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)) into R or help directly with creating new agent-based models in R following the NetLogo framework.

`NetLogoR` provides the necessary [NetLogo's primitives](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html) as well as complementary functions to build agent-based models.
A programming guide derived from the [NetLogoâ€™s Programming Guide](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html) is available. 

This package is under construction and therefore function errors and mismatches with the documentation may occur.
