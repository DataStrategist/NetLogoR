\usage{
dy(turtles, dist = 1)

\S4method{dy}{SpatialPointsDataFrame,numeric}(turtles, dist = 1)

\S4method{dy}{SpatialPointsDataFrame,missing}(turtles)

\S4method{dy}{agentMatrix,numeric}(turtles, dist = 1)

\S4method{dy}{agentMatrix,missing}(turtles)
}
\arguments{
\item{turtles}{SpatialPointsDataFrame created by \code{createTurtles()} or
by \code{createOTurtles()} representing the moving agents.}

\item{dist}{Numeric. Vector of distances the \code{turtles} would have to
move forward to
compute the increment values. Must be of length 1 or of length
\code{turtles}. The default value is \code{dist = 1}.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Vector of length \code{turtles}.
}
\description{
Report the amount by which the \code{turtles}' coordinates ycor would change
if the \code{turtles} were
to move forward the given distances with their current headings.
}
\details{
Report the cosine of the \code{turtles}' heading multiplied by the \code{dist}
         values. Heading 0 is north and angles are calculated in degrees in a
         clockwise manner.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createNLworld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 4, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 4)
t1 <- createOTurtles(world = w1, n = 10)
dy(turtles = t1)
