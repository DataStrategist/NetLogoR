\arguments{
\item{world}{\code{NLworlds} object.}

\item{agents1}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column \code{pxcor} and the
                second column \code{pycor} representing the coordinates of the
                patches from which the distances will be computed.

                SpatialPointsDataFrame created by \code{createTurtles()} or
                by \code{createOTurtles()} representing the turtles from which
                the distances will be computed.}

\item{agents2}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column \code{pxcor} and the
                second column \code{pycor} representing the coordinates of the
                patches to which the distances will be computed.

                SpatialPointsDataFrame created by \code{createTurtles()} or
                by \code{createOTurtles()} representing the turtles to which
                the distances will be computed.

                Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column \code{xcor} and the
                second column \code{ycor} representing the coordinates of the
                locations to which the distances will be computed.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{NLworlds} object is wrapped.
Default is \code{torus = FALSE}.}

\item{allPairs}{Logical. Only relevant if the number of agents/locations in
\code{agents1} and \code{agents2} is the same. If \code{FALSE}, the
distance between each agent/location in \code{agents1} with the
corresponding \code{agents2} is returned. If \code{TRUE}, a full
distance matrix is returned. Default is \code{allPairs = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Vector of distances if \code{agents1} and/or \code{agents2} contained
        one agent/location, or if \code{agents1} and \code{agents2} contained the same
        number of agents/locations and \code{allPairs = FALSE}.

        Matrix of distances between \code{agents1} (rows) and \code{agents2} (columns)
        if \code{agents1} and \code{agents2} are of different length, or of same length
        and \code{allPairs = TRUE}.
}
\description{
Report the distances between \code{agents1} and \code{agents2}.
}
\details{
Distances from/to a patch are measured from/to its center.

         If \code{torus = TRUE}, a distances around the sides of the world is
         reported only if smaller than the one across the world (i.e., as calculated
         with \code{torus = FALSE}).

         Coordinates of given \code{agents1} and \code{agents2} must be inside the world's extent.
