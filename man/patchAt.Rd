\usage{
patchAt(world, agents, dx, dy, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{patchAt}{NLworldMs,matrix,numeric,numeric}(world, agents, dx, dy,
  torus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{world}{NLworldMs object.}

\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{dx}{Numeric. Vector of distances to the east (right) from the \code{agents}.
If \code{dx} is negative, the distance to the west (left) is computed.
\code{dx} must be of length 1 or of the same length as number of patches
or turtles in \code{agents}.}

\item{dy}{Numeric. Vector of distances to the north (up) from the \code{agents}.
If \code{dy} is negative, the distance to the south is computed (down).
\code{dy} must be of length 1 or of the same length as number of patches
or turtles in \code{agents}.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{world} is wrapped. Default is
\code{torus = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second column
        "pycor" representing the coordinates of the patches at \code{(dx, dy)}
        distances of the \code{agents}. The order of the patches follows the order
        of the \code{agents}.
}
\description{
Report the coordinates of the patches at \code{(dx, dy)} distances of the \code{agents}.
}
\details{
If the patch at distance \code{(dx, dy)}
         of an agent is outside of the \code{world}'s extent and \code{torus = FALSE},
         \code{NA} are returned
         for the patch coordinates;
         if \code{torus = TRUE}, the patch coordinates from a wrapped \code{world} are
         returned.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createNLworldMatrix(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 9, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 9)
patchCorner <- patchAt(world = w1, agents = patch(w1, 0, 0), dx = 1, dy = 1)
t1 <- createTurtlesAM(n = 1, coords = cbind(xcor = 0, ycor = 0))
patchCorner <- patchAt(world = w1, agents = t1, dx = 1, dy = 1)
