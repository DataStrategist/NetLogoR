\usage{
face(turtles, agents2, world, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{face}{agentMatrix,matrix}(turtles, agents2, world, torus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{turtles}{\code{AgentMatrix} object representing the moving \code{agents}.}

\item{agents2}{Matrix (\code{ncol} = 2) with the first column \code{pxcor} and the second
               column \code{pycor} representing the \code{patches} coordinates, or

               \code{AgentMatrix} object representing the moving \code{agents}, or

               Matrix (\code{ncol} = 2) with the first column \code{x} and the second column
               \code{y} representing locations coordinates.}

\item{world}{\code{WorldMatrix} or \code{worldArray} object.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{world} is wrapped. Default is
\code{torus = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{AgentMatrix} representing the \code{turtles} with updated \code{headings}.
}
\description{
Set the \code{turtles}' \code{heading} towards \code{agents2}.
}
\details{
The number of agents/locations in \code{agents2} must be equal to 1 or
         to the length of \code{turtles}.

         If \code{torus = FALSE}, \code{world} does not need to be provided.

         If \code{torus = TRUE} and the distance from one \code{turtles} to
         its corresponding agent/location \code{agents2} is smaller around the
         sides of the \code{world} than across it, then the direction to the agent/location
         \code{agents2} going around the sides of the \code{world} is given to the \code{turtle}.

         If a turtle is facing its own location, its heading does not change.
