\usage{
moveTo(turtles, agents)

\S4method{moveTo}{agentMatrix,matrix}(turtles, agents)
}
\arguments{
\item{turtles}{AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}
}
\value{
AgentMatrix representing the \code{turtles} with updated coordinates
        and updated data for their previous coordinates "prevX" and "prevY".
}
\description{
Move the \code{turtles} to the \code{agents}' locations.
}
\details{
The number of \code{agents} must be equal to 1 or to
         length \code{turtles}.

         The \code{turtle}'s headings are not affected with this function.

         If a turtle is moving to a patch location, it will be located at
         the patch center.

w1 <- createWorld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 9, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 9,
