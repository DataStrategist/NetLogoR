\usage{
patchRight(world, turtles, dist, angle, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{patchRight}{NLworlds,SpatialPointsDataFrame,numeric,numeric}(world,
  turtles, dist, angle, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{patchRight}{NLworlds,agentMatrix,numeric,numeric}(world, turtles,
  dist, angle, torus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{world}{NLworlds object.}

\item{turtles}{SpatialPointsDataFrame created by \code{createTurtles()} or
by \code{createOTurtles()} representing the moving agents.}

\item{dist}{Numeric. Vector of distances from the \code{turtles}. \code{dist} must be
of length 1 or of length \code{turtles}.}

\item{angle}{Numeric. Vector of angles in degrees by which the \code{turtle}'s
headings should rotate to locate the patches. Must be of length 1 or of
length \code{turtles}.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{world} is wrapped. Default is
\code{torus = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
        column "pycor" representing the coordinates of the patches at \code{dist}
        distances of the \code{turtles} and \code{angle} to the right of their headings.
        The order of the patches follows the order of the \code{turtles}.
}
\description{
Report the coordinates of the patches at the given distances of the \code{turtles}
on the right of their headings.
}
\details{
If a given \code{dist} value is negative, then the turtle would move backward.
         If a given \code{angle} value is negative, then the turtle would rotate to the left.

         If \code{torus = FALSE} and the patch at distance \code{dist} of a turtle
         and \code{angle} degrees to the right of its heading is outside the \code{world}'s extent, \code{NA}
         are returned for the patch coordinates. If \code{torus = TRUE}, the patch
         coordinates from a wrapped \code{world} are returned.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createNLworld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 9, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 9)
t1 <- createTurtles(n = 1, coords = cbind(xcor = 2, ycor = 2), heading = 90)
patchRight(world = w1, turtles = t1, dist = 2, angle = 90)
