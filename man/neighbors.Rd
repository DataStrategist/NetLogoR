\usage{
neighbors(world, agents, nNeighbors, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{neighbors}{NLworlds,matrix,numeric}(world, agents, nNeighbors,
  torus = FALSE)

\S4method{neighbors}{NLworlds,SpatialPointsDataFrame,numeric}(world, agents,
  nNeighbors, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{neighbors}{NLworldMs,matrix,numeric}(world, agents, nNeighbors,
  torus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{world}{NLworlds object.}

\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              SpatialPointsDataFrame created by \code{createTurtles()} or
              by \code{createOTurtles()} representing the moving agents.}

\item{nNeighbors}{Integer: 4 or 8. Represents the number of neighbor patches
considered.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{world} is wrapped. Default is
\code{torus = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Matrix (ncol = 3) with the first column "pxcor"
        and the second column "pycor" representing the coordinates of the neighbors
        patches around the \code{agents} and the third column "id" representing
        the \code{agents}.
}
\description{
Report the coordinates of the neighbors patches around the \code{agents}.
}
\details{
The patch around which the neighbors are identified, or the patch where
         the turtle is located on around which the neighbors are identified, is not
         returned.

         If \code{torus = FALSE}, \code{agents} located on the edges of the \code{world}
         have less than \code{nNeighbors} patches around them. If \code{torus = TRUE}, all \code{agents}
         located on the egdes of the \code{world} have \code{nNeighbors} patches around them, which
         some may be on the other sides of the \code{world}.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createNLworld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 9, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 9)
neighbors(world = w1, agents = patch(w1, c(0,9), c(0,7)), nNeighbors = 8)
t1 <- createTurtles(n = 3, coords = randomXYcor(w1, n = 3))
neighbors(world = w1, agents = t1, nNeighbors = 4)
