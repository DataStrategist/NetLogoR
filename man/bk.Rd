\title{Move backward}
\usage{
bk(turtles, dist, world, torus = FALSE, out = TRUE)

\S4method{bk}{agentMatrix,numeric}(turtles, dist, world, torus = FALSE,
  out = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{turtles}{AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{dist}{Numeric. Vector of distances to move. Must
be of length 1 or of length \code{turtles}.}

\item{world}{NLworldMs object.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{world} is wrapped. Default is
\code{torus = FALSE}.}

\item{out}{Logical. Determine if a turtle should move when
\code{torus = FALSE} and its ending position will be outside of
the \code{world}'s extent. Default is \code{out = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
AgentMatrix representing the \code{turtles} with updated
        coordinates and updated data for their previous coordinates "prevX"
        and "prevY".
}
\description{
Move the \code{turtles} backward of their headings' directions.
}
\details{
If \code{torus = FALSE} and \code{out = TRUE}, \code{world}
         does not need to be provided.

         If a distance to move leads a turtle outside of the \code{world}'s extent
         and \code{torus = TRUE}, the turtle is
         relocated on the other side of the \code{world}, inside its extent; if
         \code{torus = FALSE} and \code{out = TRUE}, the turtle moves past the
         \code{world}'s extent; if \code{torus = FALSE} and \code{out = FALSE}, the
         turtle does not move at all. In the event that a turtle does not move,
         its previous coordinates are still updated with its position before
         running \code{bk()} (i.e., its current position).

         If a given \code{dist} value is negative, then the turtle moves
         forward.

         The \code{turtles}' headings are not affected by the function (i.e., the
         \code{turtles} do not face backward).
