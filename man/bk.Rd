\usage{
bk(world, turtles, step, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{bk}{NLworlds,SpatialPointsDataFrame,numeric}(world, turtles, step,
  torus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{world}{A \code{NLworld*} object, representing the world in which the
turtles move onto.}

\item{turtles}{A SpatialPointsDataFrame created by \code{createTurtles()} or
by \code{createOTurtles()} representing the agents that will move
backward.}

\item{step}{Numeric. Distance(s) by which the turtles will move backward.
Must be of length 1 if all turtles move the same distance or
of length turtles if each turtle moves a different distance.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{NLworld*} is wrapped.
Default is \code{torus = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A SpatialPointsDataFrame with updated coordinates.
}
\description{
Move the turtles backward of \code{step} distance(s) regarding the direction
of the turtles' heading.
}
\details{
If the \code{NLworld*} is wrapped (\code{torus = TRUE}) and the distance
         to move lead the turtle outside of the world's extent, it is
         relocated on the other of the world, inside the world's extent. Otherwise,
         if \code{torus = FALSE}, the turtle moves past the world's extent.
         If a given \code{step} value is negative, then the turtle moves
         forward.
         This function is equivalent to the forward function with the distance(s)
         to move equal to \code{step * -1}.
         The turtles' heading is not affected by the function (i.e., the turtles
         do not head backward).
