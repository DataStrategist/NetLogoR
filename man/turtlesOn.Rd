\usage{
turtlesOn(world, turtles, agents, breed, simplify = TRUE)

\S4method{turtlesOn}{NLworldMs,agentMatrix,matrix,missing}(world, turtles,
  agents, simplify)

\S4method{turtlesOn}{NLworldMs,agentMatrix,matrix,character}(world, turtles,
  agents, breed, simplify = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{world}{NLworldMs object.}

\item{turtles}{AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{breed}{Characters. Vector of "breed" names for the selected \code{turtles}.
If missing, there is no distinction based upon "breed".}

\item{simplify}{Logical. If \code{simplify = TRUE}, all \code{turtles} on the same
patches as any \code{agents} are returned; if \code{simplify = FALSE},
the \code{turtles} are evaluated for each \code{agents}'s patches
individually.}
}
\value{
AgentMatrix representing any individuals from \code{turtles} of
        any of the given \code{breed}, if speficied,
        located on the same patches as any of the \code{agents}, if \code{simplify = TRUE}, or

        Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "whoTurtles" and the second column
        "id" showing which \code{turtles} are on the same
        patches as which \code{agents} represented by "id", if \code{simplify = FALSE}.
        "id" represents and follows the order of the \code{agents}. "id" does not represent
        the "who" numbers
        of the \code{agents} if \code{agents} are turtles.
}
\description{
Report the individuals among \code{turtles} that are on the same patches as
the \code{agents}.
}
\details{
The \code{agents} must be located inside the
         \code{world}'s extent.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createWorld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 9, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 9,
                          data = runif(100))
t1 <- createTurtles(n = 500, coords = randomXYcor(w1, n = 500))
plot(world2raster(w1))
points(turtles2spdf(t1), col = of(agents = t1, var = "color"), pch = 16)

t2 <- turtlesOn(world = w1, turtles = t1, agents = patch(w1, 2, 2))
