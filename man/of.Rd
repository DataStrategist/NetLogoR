}
\arguments{
\item{world}{WorldMatrix or worldArray object.}

\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{var}{Character. Vector of the name of the selected \code{agents} variables.
If \code{agents} are patches and the \code{world} is a
\code{worldMatrix} object, \code{var} must not be provided. If
\code{agents} are patches and the \code{world} is a
\code{worldArray} object, \code{var} is the name of the layers to
use to define the patches
values. If \code{agents} are turtles, \code{var} is some of
the turtles' variable and can be any of the variables created
when turtles were created,
as well as any variable created with \code{turtlesOwn()}.}
}
\value{
Vector of values for the \code{agents} if one variable is
        requested. The class depends
        of the variable class. The order of the vector follows the order
        of the \code{agents}, or

        Matrix or Dataframe (ncol = \code{length(var)}, nrow = \code{NLcount(agents)})
        if more than one variable is requested. The row order
        follows the order of the \code{agents}.
}
\description{
Report the \code{agents} values for the requested variable.
}
\details{
\code{world} must be provided only if \code{agents} are patches.
}
\examples{
# Patches
w1 <- createWorld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 4, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 4,
                          data = 1:25)
of(world = w1, agents = patch(w1, c(0,0), c(4,0)))

# Turtles
t1 <- createTurtles(n = 10, coords = randomXYcor(w1, n = 10))
of(agents = t1, var = "heading")
