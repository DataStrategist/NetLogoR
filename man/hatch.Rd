\title{Hatch new turtles}
\usage{
hatch(turtles, who, n, breed)

\S4method{hatch}{agentMatrix,numeric,numeric}(turtles, who, n, breed)
}
\arguments{
\item{turtles}{AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{who}{Integer. Vector of the "who" numbers for the selected \code{turtles}.}

\item{n}{Integer. Vector of length 1 or of length \code{who}. Number of new turtles
to create for each parent.}

\item{breed}{Character. One "breed" name. If missing,
the created turtles are of the same "breed" as their parent turtle.}
}
\value{
AgentMatrix representing the \code{turtles} with the new
        hatched ones.
}
\description{
Create new turtles from parent turtles.
}
\details{
The parent turtle must be contained in the \code{turtles}.

         The created turtles inherit of all the data from the parent turtle,
         except for the "breed" if specified otherwise, and for the "who" numbers.
         The "who" numbers of the turtles created take on following the highest
         "who" number among the \code{turtles}.

         All new hatched turtles are placed at the end of the agentMatrix object.

w1 <- createNLworldMatrix(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 4, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 4)
t1 <- createTurtlesAM(n = 10, world = w1)
NLcount(t1)
t1 <- hatch(turtles = t1, who = 0, n = 2)
NLcount(t1)
