\usage{
other(agents, except)

\S4method{other}{matrix,matrix}(agents, except)
}
\arguments{
\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{except}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}
}
\value{
Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
        column "pycor" representing the patches in \code{agents} without
        the ones in \code{except}, or

        AgentMatrix representing the turtles in \code{agents} without
        the ones in \code{except}.
}
\description{
Report an agentset of the \code{agents} except specific ones.
}
\details{
Both \code{agents} and \code{except} must be of the same class (e.g., both
         patches or both turtles).

         Carefull: this function removes turtles only based on similar "who" numbers
         and "breed" names.

\examples{
# Patches
w1 <- createNLworldMatrix(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 9, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 9) # 100 patches
p1 <- other(agents = patches(w1), except = patch(w1, 0, 0))
NLcount(p1) # 99 patches

# Turtles
t1 <- createTurtlesAM(n = 10, coords = cbind(xcor = 0, ycor = 0)) # 10 turtles
t2 <- other(agents = t1, except = turtle(t1, who = 0))
NLcount(t2) # 9 turtles
