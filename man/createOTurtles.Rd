\usage{
createOTurtles(n, world, breed, color)

\S4method{createOTurtles}{numeric}(n, world, breed, color)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer.}

\item{world}{WorldMatrix or worldArray object.}

\item{breed}{Character. Vector of "breed" names. Must be of length 1 or of length
\code{n}. If missing, \code{breed = "turtle"} for all turtles.}

\item{color}{Character. Vector of color names. Must be of length \code{n}.
If missing, colors are assigned using the function \code{rainbow(n)}.}
}
\value{
AgentMatrix object of length \code{n} with data for the
        turtles being: "xcor", "ycor", "who", "heading", "prevX", "prevY", "breed",
        and "color".
}
\description{
Create \code{n} turtles at the center of the \code{world} with their headings evenly
distributed.
}
\details{
The identity of the turtles is defined by their "who" number. This
         numbering starts at 0 and increments by 1.

         The coordinates from the previous time step are stored in "prevX" and
         "prevY". The initial values are \code{NA}.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createWorld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 4, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 4,
                          data = runif(25))
t1 <- createOTurtles(n = 10, world = w1)
plot(w1)
points(t1, col = of(agents = t1, var = "color"), pch = 16)

t1 <- fd(turtles = t1, dist = 1)
points(t1, col = of(agents = t1, var = "color"), pch = 16)
