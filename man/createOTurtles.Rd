\title{Create ordered turtles}
\usage{
createOTurtles(n, world, breed, color)

\S4method{createOTurtles}{numeric,NLworlds}(n, world, breed, color)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. The number of new turtles to create.}

\item{world}{A \code{NLworlds} object, representing the world in which the turtles
will evolve.}

\item{breed}{String of characters. Either of length 1 representing the breed
for all turtles or of length \code{n} if the different turtles have
different breeds. If missing, \code{breed = "turtle"} for all turtles.}

\item{color}{String of characters of length \code{n} representing the color
of each turtle when plotted. If missing, colors are assigned using
the function \code{rainbow(n)}.}
}
\value{
A SpatialPointsDataFrame object of length \code{n} with the columns for
        the dataframe being: "who", "heading", "prevX", "prevY", "breed", and "color".
}
\description{
Create \code{n} new turtles at the center of the world with their headings evenly
distributed.
}
\details{
The identity of the turtles is defined by their "who" number. This
         numbering starts at 0 and increments by 1.
         The first turtle \code{who = 0} has its heading set to 0.
         The coordinates from the previous time step are stored in "prevX" and
         "prevY". The initial values are \code{NA}.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createNLworld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 4, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 4)
w1[] <- runif(25)
t1 <- createOTurtles(n = 10, world = w1)
plot(w1)
points(t1, pch = 16, col = t1@data$color)
t1 <- fd(world = w1, turtles = t1, step = 1)
points(t1, pch = 16, col = t1@data$color)

\dontrun{
# Can be used with Plot in package SpaDES for modular plotting that is faster with large datasets
  library(SpaDES)
  clearPlot()
  Plot(w1)
  Plot(t1, addTo ="w1") # automatically uses color column in SpatialPointsDataFrame
