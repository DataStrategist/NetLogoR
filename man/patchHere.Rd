\usage{
patchHere(world, turtles)

\S4method{patchHere}{NLworlds,SpatialPointsDataFrame}(world, turtles)
}
\arguments{
\item{world}{NLworlds object.}

\item{turtles}{SpatialPointsDataFrame created by \code{createTurtles()} or
by \code{createOTurtles()} representing the moving agents.}
}
\value{
Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second column
        "pycor" representing the coordinates of the patches at the \code{turtles}
        location. The order of the patches follows the order of the \code{turtles}.
}
\description{
Report the coordinates of the patches under the \code{turtles}
locations.
}
\details{
If a turtle is located outside of the \code{world}'s extent, \code{NA} are returned
         for the patch coordinates.
}
\examples{
w1 <- createNLworld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 9, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 9)
t1 <- createTurtles(n = 10, coords = randomXYcor(w1, n = 10))
patchHere(world = w1, turtles = t1)
