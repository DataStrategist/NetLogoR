\usage{
towards(agents, agents2, world, torus = FALSE)

\S4method{towards}{matrix,matrix}(agents, agents2, world, torus = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{agents2}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
               column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

               AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents, or

               Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "x and the second column
               "y" representing locations coordinates.}

\item{world}{NLworldMs object.}

\item{torus}{Logical to determine if the \code{world} is wrapped. Default is
\code{torus = FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Numeric. Vector of angles in degrees of length equal to the largest
        number of agents/locations between \code{agents} and \code{agents2}.
}
\description{
Report the directions of each \code{agents} towards each corresponding \code{agents2}.
}
\details{
\code{agents} and \code{agents2} must have the same number of agents/locations
         or if different, one of them must have only one agent/location. If
         \code{agents} and \code{agents2} have the same number of agents/locations,
         the directions are calculated for each pair \code{agents[i]} and \code{agents2[i]}
         and not for each \code{agents} towards every single \code{agents2}.

         If \code{torus = FALSE}, \code{world} does not need to be provided.

         If \code{torus = TRUE} and the distance from one \code{agents} to
         its corresponding \code{agents2} is smaller around the
         sides of the \code{world} than across it, then the direction to \code{agents2}
         going around the sides of the \code{world} is returned.

         The direction from a patch to its location returns 0; the direction from
         a turtle to its location returns the turtle's heading.

t1 <- createTurtles(n = 10, world = w1)
