\usage{
NLwith(agents, world, var, val)

\S4method{NLwith}{matrix,worldMatrix,missing}(agents, world, val)

\S4method{NLwith}{matrix,worldArray,character}(agents, world, var, val)

\S4method{NLwith}{agentMatrix,missing,character}(agents, var, val)
}
\arguments{
\item{agents}{Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second
              column "pycor" representing the patches coordinates, or

              AgentMatrix object representing the moving agents.}

\item{world}{WorldMatrix or worldArray object.}

\item{var}{Character. The name of the selected \code{agents} variable.
If \code{agents} are patches and the \code{world} is a
worldMatrix object, \code{var} must not be provided. If
\code{agents} are patches and the \code{world} is a worldArray
object, \code{var} is the name of the layer to use to define the patches
values. If \code{agents} are turtles, \code{var} is one of
the turtles' variable and can be equal to \code{"xcor"},
\code{"ycor"}, any of the variables created when turtles were created,
as well as any variable created using \code{turtlesOwn()}.}

\item{val}{Numeric or character. Vector of any length.}
}
\value{
Matrix (ncol = 2) with the first column "pxcor" and the second column
        "pycor" representing the coordinates of the patches among the \code{agents}
        which have their variable
        equals to any \code{val}, or

        AgentMatrix representing the turtles among the \code{agents}
        which have their variable
        \code{var} equals to any \code{val}.
}
\description{
Report the patches or the turtles among \code{agents} which have their variable
equals to a specific value.
}
\details{
\code{world} must not be provided if \code{agents} are turtles.

         This is equivalent in R to subsetting.

\examples{
# Patches
w1 <- createWorld(minPxcor = 0, maxPxcor = 4, minPycor = 0, maxPycor = 4,
                          data = sample(1:5, size = 25, replace = TRUE))
plot(world2raster(w1))
p2 <- NLwith(agents = patches(w1), world = w1, val = 2)

# Turtles
t1 <- createTurtles(n = 5, coords = randomXYcor(w1, n = 5),
                    breed = c("sheep", "sheep", "wolf", "sheep", "sheperd"))
t2 <- NLwith(agents = t1, var = "breed", val = "sheep")
t3 <- NLwith(agents = t1, var = "breed", val = c("sheep", "wolf"))
