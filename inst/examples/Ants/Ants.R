## Packages required
#library(NetLogoR)
#library(testthat) # for testing

## Global variables (model parameters)
nAnts <- 125 # varies from 0 to 200 in the NetLogo model
rDiff <- 50 # varies from 0 to 99 in the NetLogo model
rEvap <- 10 # varies from 0 to 99 in the NetLogo model
# torus = FALSE


## Model setup
# World
# One worldMatrix for each patch variable, then stack them
# As all the worldMatrix must have the same extent, you can copy past the object to a new name
# Patch values must be assigned to each world before stacking them

# Chemical
chemical <- createWorld(minPxcor = -35, maxPxcor = 35, minPycor = -35, maxPycor = 35, data = 0) # amount of chemical on the patches

# Nest
nest <- chemical # 1 on nest patches, 0 elsewhere
nestScent <- chemical # higher closer to the nest
distNest <- NLdist(agents = patches(nest), agents2 = cbind(x = 0, y = 0))
patchNest <- which(distNest < 5) # patch/cell numbers for the ones at distance less than 5 from [x = 0, y = 0]
nest <- NLset(world = nest, agents = patches(nest), val = 0) # 0 to all the patches
nest <- NLset(world = nest, agents = PxcorPycorFromCell(world = nest, cellNum = patchNest), val = 1) # and reassign 1 to the patches in the nest
nestScent <- NLset(world = nestScent, agents = patches(nestScent), val = 200 - distNest) # spread nestScent over the whole world, stronger near the nest

# Food
foodSource <- chemical # number (1, 2, or 3) to identify the food sources
food <- chemical # amount of food on the patches (0, 1, or 2)
distFood1 <- NLdist(agents = patches(foodSource), agents2 = cbind(x = 0.6 * maxPxcor(foodSource), y = 0)) # setup food source 1 on the right

foodSource <- NLset(world = foodSource, agents = PxcorPycorFromCell(world = foodSource, cellNum = patchFood2), val = 2) # and reassign 2 to the patches in the foodSource 2
distFood3 <- NLdist(agents = patches(foodSource), agents2 = cbind(x = -0.8 * maxPxcor(foodSource), y = 0.8 * maxPycor(foodSource))) # setup food source 3 on the upper-left
patchFood3 <- which(distFood3 < 5)

# Ants
ants <- createTurtles(n = nAnts, coords = cbind(xcor = 0, ycor = 0), color = "red") # red = not carrying food

# plot(world) # all the layers
# plot(ants) # the ants only
