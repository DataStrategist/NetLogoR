Package: NetLogoR
Title: A Port of NetLogo Functions and Language to R
Description: NetLogoR is an R package that
    aims to help translating agent-based models built in 'NetLogo'
    (Wilensky, 1999; http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) into R or help
    directly with creating new agent-based models in R following the 'NetLogo'
    framework. 'NetLogoR' provides the necessary 'NetLogo' primitives
    (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html) as well as
    complementary functions to build agent-based models. A programming guide
    derived from that of 'NetLogo' 
    (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html) is
    available. NOTE: To increment 'time', these functions can use
    a for loop or can be integrated with a discrete event simulator,
    such as 'SpaDES'.
