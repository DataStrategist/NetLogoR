Package: NetLogoR
Title: A port of NetLogo functions and language to R
Description: This package is under active development and therefore function
    errors and documentation mismatches may occur. `NetLogoR` is an R package
    which aims to help translating agent-based models built in NetLogo
    ([Wilensky, 1999](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)) into R or help
    directly with creating new agent-based models in R following the NetLogo
    framework. `NetLogoR` provides the necessary [NetLogo's primitives]
    (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html) as well as
    complementary functions to build agent-based models. A programming guide
    derived from the [NetLogoâ€™s Programming Guide]
    (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html) is available.
    NOTE: there is no support for 'time' in this package -- it is currently
    intended to be used with `SpaDES`.
