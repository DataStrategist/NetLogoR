Package: NetLogoR
Title: A Port of 'NetLogo' Functions and Language to R
Description: Easily create agent-based models in R
    following the 'NetLogo' framework
    (Wilensky, 1999; http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
    'NetLogoR' provides classes to represent 'patches' (raster cells)
    and 'turtles' (individuals),
    the necessary 'NetLogo' primitives
    (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html),
    and complementary functions to easily build agent-based models
    or translate 'NetLogo' models in R.
    A programming guide derived from the 'NetLogo' Programming Guide
    (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/programming.html)
    and a dictionary of 'NetLogo' primitives
    (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html)
    equivalences are available.
    As examples, three 'NetLogo' models
    (Ants; http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Ants;
    Butterfly; Railsback and Grimm, 2012;
    Wolf-Sheep-Predation; http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation)
    were translated in R language using 'NetLogoR'.
    NOTE: To increment 'time', these functions can use
    a for loop or can be integrated with a discrete event simulator,
    such as 'SpaDES'.
